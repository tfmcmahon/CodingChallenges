Name of peer: Tamas
CS background: 

What can I improve?: 
What did my peer think I can improve?: Ask more clarifying questions earlier; anticipate more issues. We didn't anticipate how money is inserted into the machine.
We also could have created a better change object and make change function that could accept different denominations down the road.

What did I do well?: Successfully create two classes that interacted with eachother.
What did peer think I did well?: Wrote usable code within the time limit
